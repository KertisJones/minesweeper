# Tetrisweeper
Can't decide whether to play Minesweeper or Tetris? Why not play both?

Tetrisweeper is a mind-bending fusion of two classic puzzle games that will have you working two parts of your mind at once. 

In order to win this game, you'll have to play both Tetris and Minesweeper at the same time. Block fall just like Tetris, but every square inside operates like a Minesweeper tile. In order to clear a row, you must fill every empty space and solve each tile's minesweeper puzzle. Let the tower reach the top, or accidently click on a mine, and that's game over.
